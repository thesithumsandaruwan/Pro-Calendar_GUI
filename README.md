A console-based calendar application for managing events in July 2024. Features include scheduling meetings, marking day-offs, handling repeating events, and viewing day, week, or month summaries. The app prevents overlapping events, validates time input, and ensures no meetings on past dates or day-offs (unless allowed on weekends). Users can also edit, shift, or delete scheduledÂ events.
